# Chatbot Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to answer user questions. It preprocesses user input and matches it against a database of processed questions to retrieve relevant answers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- nltk
- tkinter (for UI)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository using `git clone`.
2. Install required libraries by running `pip install pandas nltk`.
3. Download NLTK resources by running `python -m nltk.downloader all`.
4. Run the chatbot UI using `python chatbot_ui.py`.

## Usage
1. Run the chatbot UI.
2. Enter your question in the input field.
3. Click "Submit" to get the answer.

## Project Structure
- `chatbot_ui.py`: The main script for the chatbot UI.
- `module1.py`: Script for preprocessing questions and answers.
- `module2.py`: Script for user interaction and response retrieval.
- `processed_questions_answers.csv`: The processed dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance preprocessing steps for better accuracy.
- Expand the dataset for more comprehensive answers.
- Implement more advanced NLP models for improved performance.
